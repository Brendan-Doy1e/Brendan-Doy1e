## Hey there!
I'm Brendan, a Computer Systems Technology grad from BCIT, with a foundation in software development, data analysis, IT operations, support, and cloud services. Iâ€™ve worked on development projects, IT systems, cloud administration, database migration and hands-on troubleshooting. I'm always looking to grow my skills, especially in cybersecurity, data science, and cloud infrastructure.

Outside of tech, I'm passionate about golf, travel, video games, warhammer, and adventure sports.
